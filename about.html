                <h2>Welcome to Bratcher Cubing</h2>
                <p>
                    This site is a resource to <i>anyone</i> who is even slightly interested in solving Rubik's Cubes.
                    The goal is to create a more friendly environment for beginners and veterans alike to share experiences and learn how to quicken their own speeds.
                    It will also serve as a bit of a contact page for myself so that anyone can get in touch with me for whatever may concern them.
                    <strong>Below is a video on one of my solves.</strong>

                <h3>Home Page (hint: you're on it!)</h3>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the home page! Here I will simply be giving you a aesthetically pleasing introduction to the website.<br>
                    It will act as a central point for every page on the site.
                    It may even act as a bit of a quick news digest page regarding the site.
                </p>
                <h3>Solve the Cube!</h3>
                <p>
                    This page is going to be centered around the beginners of speed cubing.
                    Quite simply, it is a step by step guide on how to solve a Rubik's Cube.
                    It goes over the most popular method, the Fredrich method, but there are many other methods to try out.
                    Pick one that suits your own tastes!
                </p>
                <h3>Challenge Me</h3>
                <p>
                    This page may feature a bunch of my own solve statistics.
                    It also includes a scrambler widget and timer for your own struggles.
                    By no means should you measure yourself against someone else in order to judge your skill, but the option is there for those of you daring enough!
                </p>
                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>
                    The fourth and final page is my about page.
                    Here you can find a form to send me any comments or questions about certain aspects of the website or cubing itself.
